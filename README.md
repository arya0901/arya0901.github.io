    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Arya Dixit, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am passionate about technology, learning new programming languages, and exploring innovative solutions in electronics and communication systems. My interests include embedded systems, circuit design, and software development. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy working on projects that combine creativity with practical application. Alongside my academics, I’m also developing my skills in Python and C programming to strengthen my problem-solving and coding abilities.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I am deeply interested in how technology can be used to solve real-world problems and improve everyday life. I enjoy participating in hackathons, collaborating with peers, and sharing knowledge through teamwork. My curiosity drives me to learn not only about electronics but also software and hardware integration, which is essential in today’s rapidly evolving tech-driven world.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I like exploring new tools, reading about the latest innovations in engineering, and practicing coding challenges to sharpen my logical thinking. My goal is to grow as a versatile engineer, combining strong technical knowledge with creativity and problem-solving skills to contribute meaningfully to projects in electronics, communication, and beyond.</p>
